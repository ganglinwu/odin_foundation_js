1 - Erase mode, erase all, pen up, pen down, change color 
(Turns out it is really hard to implement pen up/down through removeEventListener,if I come up with a better way to implement this feature, I will revert this decision)
2 - drop down menu to switch modes
3 - keyboard shortcuts to switch modes
4 - visual prompt with fade to inform user of current mode
(this has been overridden by highlighted buttons)
5 - tips prompt suggest user to use keyboard shortcuts
(this has been overridden by huge letters on buttons)
6 - change color from color wheel
(will probably remove this as I have taken too much time to do this)
7 - change resolution/density of grid(implement ceiling of 150)
8 - dark mode
(will remove this as I have taken too much time to do this project)
9 - flashing boxes(dark mode)
(removed together with dark mode)
